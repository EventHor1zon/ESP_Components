#### Utilites

### Description

This module contains utility data, functions and "classes" which are used by various components, usually for debugging or simple macros. However I decided this would be a good storage space for various under-developped abstract "classes" which can also be used by multiple components in an abstract way. Obviously I need to think of a better way to arrange this.

### TODOs

- Make separate folders for abstractors
- Write documentation for utility functions
