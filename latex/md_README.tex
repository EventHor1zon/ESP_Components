A small library of my E\+S\+P-\/\+I\+D\+F/\+Free\+R\+T\+OS based Components for various devices.

\subsubsection*{Design}

Each driver is written using E\+S\+P-\/\+I\+DF and Free\+R\+T\+OS v9(?).

Each driver follows a basic pattern


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Each driver has a task. This task is periodic if device mode requires, else waits on task notifications
\item Each driver has an init function which should take a pointer to an init structure and return a handle to the driver structure or N\+U\+LL
\item \hyperlink{structThe}{The} driver structures are stored in allocated heap memory (I know it\textquotesingle{}s baad practice, but the E\+SP has so much memory... where else could I store them, I wonder?)
\item Each driver controls a single device (lookin at you, W\+S2812b driver!)
\item Each driver has a set of public Getter/\+Setter functions, which take as arguments a device handle and a pointer to a value (set) or value storage (get)
\item Each driver contains a map of parameters for use with my peripheral manager (see E\+S\+P\+Home for more deets)
\item Each driver should have a Task\+Handle for notifications
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Informations}

Some of these drivers built with inspiration or borrowed sections from other\textquotesingle{}s code. Credit where it\textquotesingle{}s due.
